# homepage

This is a my portfolio which was built using, HTML, CSS, javascript and react. I first built the website from scratch using HTML
and CSS but the website was not only static but it was running extremely slow; Considering I used a collage on the homepage and 
collage style template on the projects page to display my projects. I then implemented Javascript and react so my website could 
run smoother. I am constantly adding and expanding my webpage, especially the projects page and editing kinks as I go on other
pages on my site. This is solely a PORTFOLIO to display my work and skills.
